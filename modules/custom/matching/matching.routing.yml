# In order to to create pages it is necessary to define routes for them.
# A route maps a URL path to a controller. It defines what function

# If the user accesses http://drupal8.dev//candidates, the routing
# system will look for a route with that path. In this case it will find a
# match, and execute the _controller callback. In this case the callback is
